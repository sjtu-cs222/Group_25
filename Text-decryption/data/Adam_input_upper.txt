WHATEVER BE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE SKILL, DEXTERITY, AND JUDGMENT,
WITH WHICH LABOUR IS APPLIED IN ANY NATION, THE ABUNDANCE OR
SCANTINESS OF ITS ANNUAL SUPPLY MUST DEPEND, DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF
THAT STATE, UPON THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO ARE
ANNUALLY EMPLOYED IN USEFUL LABOUR, AND THAT OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT SO
EMPLOYED. THE NUMBER OF USEFUL AND PRODUCTIVE LABOURERS, IT WILL
HEREAFTER APPEAR, IS EVERYWHERE IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF
CAPITAL STOCK WHICH IS EMPLOYED IN SETTING THEM TO WORK, AND TO THE
PARTICULAR WAY IN WHICH IT IS SO EMPLOYED. THE SECOND BOOK, THEREFORE,
TREATS OF THE NATURE OF CAPITAL STOCK, OF THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS
GRADUALLY ACCUMULATED, AND OF THE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF LABOUR WHICH
IT PUTS INTO MOTION, ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH IT IS
EMPLOYED.
